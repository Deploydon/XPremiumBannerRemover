## X Premium Banner Remover

I bought 1 year of X Premium +, and then immediately canceled. This way it will not auto renew in a year. As a result, a banner appeared on the side indicating my premium is expiring soon.

I did not want to have to look at that for a year.

This extension runs on X.com and if it detects this banner, it will remove it.
